3. Add a movie to the 3rd position of the array and display the length.
4. Use the delete operator to remove the first movie from the array.
5. Use a loop to iterate through an array of 7 movies and display each movie.
6. Use a `for-in` loop to iterate and display each movie.
7. Sort and display the array using a `for-in` loop.
8. Create arrays for movies you like and regret watching, and display them in the console.
9. Merge the two arrays using `concat()` and display in reverse order.
10. Display the last item in the merged array.

## Part 4 - The Product Inventory Management System (20 points)
- Create an inventory system using a multi-dimensional array.
